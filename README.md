# PCB Color Palette

A PCB Color Palette where you can see all the possible colors in a 2 layer PCB, useful for reference in creating PCB Art:

I have used [KiCad v5.1.6](https://www.kicad.org/) for designing this Card.

The files inside KiCad look like this

## Tips on creating PCB Art

Start creating your design by layers. [This video by TwinkleTwinkie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sbkvza8cKQE) gives a good tutorial on how the whole proccess works. 
Keep in mind how **Unexposed Copper**, **Exposed Copper**, **SilkScreen** and **Naked FR4** look like. Try to play with those combinations. 
He also shows a good overview of the color palette you will have:

I also have a small [PCB Business Card project](https://github.com/Hanqaqa/PCB_Business_Card) where I use some other tools like [Svg2Shenzen](https://github.com/badgeek/svg2shenzhen) that will help you in creating PCB Art.

## Sending the File

Once I had everything finished. I prepared my Gerber files in KiCad, packed them inside a rar and ordered them to PCBWAY with standard 0.8mm thickness and everything else with default settings, HASL with lead, FR4 base, several PCB Colors... 10 of them cost me 5$ + 13$ shipping.

In this repository you can find the [Gerber files](https://github.com/Hanqaqa/PCB_Color_Palette/blob/master/Gerbers) I made in KiCad and sent to PCBWAY.
